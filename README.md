# woobloo

This is the static implementation of the woobloo frontend.

Ideally, this codebase will run independently and can be hosted using any static site provider (such as github pages for a proof of concept). The only dependency will be to a gameserver url, which can be provided as a hash parameter for instance)

## Setup - Development Mode

1. Clone repository
2. Navigate to directory
3. `npm install`
4. `npm test` (Unit testing is good)
5. `npm start`
